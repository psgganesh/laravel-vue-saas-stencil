## Learning Laravel Jetstream

Laravel Jetstream is a beautifully designed application scaffolding for Laravel. Jetstream provides the perfect starting point for your next Laravel application and includes login, registration, email verification, two-factor authentication, session management, API support via [Laravel Sanctum](https://github.com/laravel/sanctum), and optional team management.

Jetstream is designed using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and offers your choice of [Livewire](https://jetstream.laravel.com/2.x/stacks/livewire.html) or [Inertia](https://jetstream.laravel.com/2.x/stacks/inertia.html) scaffolding.

## Learning Inertia

Inertia.js lets you quickly build modern single-page React, Vue and Svelte apps using classic server-side routing and controllers.

The information on [Inertia website](https://inertiajs.com) can help. Inertia allows you to create fully client-side rendered, single-page apps, without much of the complexity that comes with modern SPAs. It does this by leveraging existing server-side frameworks.

Inertia has no client-side routing, nor does it require an API. Simply build controllers and page views like you've always done!

## Learning Vue

Vue.js is an open-source model–view–viewmodel front end JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.

You can visit the [Vue mastery website](https://www.vuemastery.com/) for tutorials on how to create Vue.js applications. Vue.js lets you extend HTML with HTML attributes called directives. Vue.js directives offers functionality to HTML applications and provides built-in directives and user defined directives.
